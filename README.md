# cmbDirVisualizer

FOR MY NEWER ADVENTURES PLEASE LOOK AT https://github.com/coentjo/GlamorousAdventures

This was my first try in creating a visualizer to look at the content of the zip files that students submitted.

A zip contains a 'readme.txt' and subdirectories containing (by default) C#-projects. Those subdirectories are shown in a circle.

+ Starting from the middle circle (base dir) going to the outside are subdirectories and files.
+ On the right sight: the (bright) colors are are newest files: purple for '*.sln', orange for '.cs'.
+ Going against the clock the colors turn dark when the last modification is older.
+ Clicking on a source file will show the contents of that file.

It helps me get a quick insight in a zip file containing projects created by my students.
